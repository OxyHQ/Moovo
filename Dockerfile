# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.7
#
# Production image for the @moovo/backend service.
#
# Multi-stage, multi-arch. `node:22-alpine` and `oven/bun` are multi-arch
# manifests, so this image builds natively on AWS Graviton (linux/arm64) as well
# as x86_64 — Docker selects the right base layer per target platform.
#
# Build context is the monorepo ROOT (bun workspaces):
#   docker build -t moovo-backend:test .
#
# Pipeline:
#   build: bun install --frozen-lockfile (incl. devDependencies for the build)
#          && bun run build:backend           (tsc shared-types + esbuild bundle
#                                               -> packages/backend/dist/index.js)
#          && reinstall production-only deps
#   run:   node packages/backend/dist/index.js
#
# @moovo/shared-types is a first-party workspace package; the API bundle
# INLINES it (see packages/backend/build.ts), so the runtime image needs neither
# its dist nor its build-time devDependencies.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Stage 1: builder — install the full dependency graph and bundle the API.
