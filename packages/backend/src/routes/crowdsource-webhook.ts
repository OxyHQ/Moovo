/**
 * `POST /webhooks/crowdsource` — where decisions come back.
 *
 * ## The mount is part of the correctness
 *
 * This router MUST be mounted BEFORE `express.json()` in `index.ts`. The
 * signature covers the bytes that arrived, and once a JSON parser has run those
 * bytes are gone — `@oxyhq/crowdsource-express` needs the raw Buffer and will
 * refuse rather than verify a signature over a re-serialisation. That refusal is
 * the correct behaviour, and it is also why the mount order cannot be got wrong
 * silently. A test asserts `typeof req.body === 'undefined'` inside the route,
 * which is what proves no parser ran ahead of it.
 *
 * ## What this handler does and does not do
 *
 * It records and returns. Applying a decision means reading reports, planning
 * enforcement and writing several collections, and a receiver that did all that
 * inline would time out under a burst and be retried while the first attempt was
 * still running. So the event and a durable `decision.apply` outbox row commit in
 * ONE transaction, and the dispatcher does the work.
 *
 * Nothing here is authenticated by Oxy. The HMAC IS the authentication, and an
 * Oxy session must never satisfy this route — it is not a user endpoint. It is
 * mounted ahead of the global rate limiter for the same reason: a burst of
 * legitimate decisions must not be shed as though it were abuse.
