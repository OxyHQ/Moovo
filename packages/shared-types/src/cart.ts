/**
 * Cart DTOs for the Moovo buyer commerce flow.

 * variant reference + quantity, NEVER a price. Prices and availability are read
 * LIVE from the variant at view time, so `unitPrice`/`lineTotal`/`subtotal` and
 * the `stale` flags always reflect current catalog state — inventory is reserved
 * at checkout, not when an item is added.

 * when the variant/listing has disappeared or its `available` has dropped below
 * the requested `quantity` (so the client can prompt the buyer to adjust).
